Welcome to XieCraft, the new home of Xie's mods! Two years ago today I released my first Mineraft mod (for those who don't remember it was a hunger mod ^_^), so I thought I'd commemorate this anniversary of sorts by building a website to host my mod, instead of continuing to burden the Minecraft forum. Not to say I won't be monitoring my old forum thread - feel free to keep posting bug reports and feedback there, at least for the time being ;)

A quick tour - there's an About page with some (almost useless) information on it about this site, my mods and me, and a Downloads page where you can download the mod and additional content for it. That's it for now, but there's more to come! :)
