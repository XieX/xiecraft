### [Download Xie's Mod Feb13](/assets/files/downloads/releases/Feb13/Xie.zip)
For Minecraft 1.4.7

![New default content](/assets/img/posts/releases/new_default_content.jpg)

## New Default Content

Compliments of Cylan, the default content has undergone a structural and visual overhaul! 

<!--more-->

Not that there was anything wrong with Thistle's textures - they were great, especially at 32x32, so I'll be rearranging them to be compatible with the new default content and releasing them as a texture pack for my mod at a latter date.

## Bug fixes

In addition to numerous refactoring, I fixed several bugs, most notable of which:

* Fixes for freezes during world generation
* Better support for block IDs > 255 (including above)
* Fix for stem block support
* A couple of recipe glitches fixed
* A couple of campfire glitches fixed (e.g. becomesWhenDestroyed default)

## How to install

Just download the zip file and copy it into your minecraft/mods/ directory. You will need to have installed Minecraft Forge for it to work. The default content is included.

If you don't want to play with the default content, or if you need to edit block or item ids, you will need to extract the zip into ./mods/Xie, so that there are ./mods/Xie/content and ./mods/Xie/mod directories.
