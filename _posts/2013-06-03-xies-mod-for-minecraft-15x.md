It's finally done! A version of Xie's Mod for Minecraft 1.5.x!

### [Download](assets/files/downloads/releases/2013_Jun_03/Xie's%20Mod%20Jun3%20for%20Minecraft%201.5.x.zip)

This is a hacked together update of my previous version (Xie's Mod v2.0 is still a work in progress, but this should tide us over for the time being). It still contains a couple of bugs (see below for a list that I will try to keep updated as bugs are discovered/fixed, hopefully more of the latter than the former!)

## Installation

To install, you'll need to unzip the above download into your .minecraft/mods/ directory, so that the contained "Xie" folder is inside the /mods/ directory.

## Known Bugs

Here is a list of known bugs, if you find a bug that isn't on this list feel free to let me know.

* wheat override is buggy as all get out, and has been disabled till I can fix it
* only shrubs and apple trees spawn naturally, other varieties do not (e.g. wild corn, orange trees et al)
* some glitches with the top level of corn crops not popping when harvested
* fertilizing custom crops is still the old fashioned way (grows it to max)
