Possibly the coldest I've ever experienced seeing as how I was in Washington DC. While we have had a relatively mild winter this year, it's still a rather stark contrast with the sweltering heat of a Brisbane summer that I'm used to. Not complaining, mind you - Brisbane can keep its humidity! I would've liked to have had a good ole Aussie BBQ though. Instead I had to settle for a _Tim Tam slam_. Life can be tough like that sometimes.
