## Bone Sword

<table class='weapon-table'>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Bone Sword" src="assets/img/posts/weapons/bone_sword.png" height="32" width="32" />

The bone sword is an early game upgrade to the vanilla stone sword. It does as much damage as an iron sword, but is far more fragile, only having as many uses as a stone sword. The bone sword goes great with the "Survival Tweaks" mod, as it gives you an alternative to an iron sword. Furthermore, bone swords are more enchantable than stone swords.

## Glass Sword

<table class='weapon-table'>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Glass Sword" src="assets/img/posts/weapons/glass_sword.png" height="32" width="32" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
  <tr><td>
      Damage:
    </td><td>
      7
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>
      Uses:
    </td><td>

  </tr>
  <tr><td>

  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">

  </td></tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


The glass sword is a mid-game alternative to the vanilla iron sword, being very readily crafted. It's a poor man's diamond sword, dealing as much damage, but they break very quickly. Furthermore, glass swords can't be used to block. Another bonus is that they are highly enchantable.

## Blaze Sword

<table class='weapon-table'>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Blaze Sword" src="assets/img/posts/weapons/blaze_sword.png" height="32" width="32" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
  <tr><td>
      Damage:
    </td><td>
      7
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>
      Uses:
    </td><td>
      59
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>
      Enchantability:
    </td><td> 
      15
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">
      Flaming
  </td></tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The blaze sword is a late game alternative to the diamond sword, doing as much damage, and having built in fire aspect! It burns out pretty quickly though. Its inherent magical nature makes it highly enchantable.

## Bone Bow

<table class='weapon-table'>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Bone Bow" src="assets/img/posts/weapons/bone_bow.png" height="32" width="32" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
  <tr><td>
      Uses:
    </td><td>
      131
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The bone bow is an early game alternative to the vanilla wooden bow, being pretty much the same, but crafted of bone instead of sticks. One benefit over the wooden bow is that it is more enchantable.

## Blaze Bow

<table class='weapon-table'>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Blaze Bow" src="assets/img/posts/weapons/blaze_bow.png" height="32" width="32" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
  <tr><td>
      Uses:
    </td><td>
      100
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">
      Flaming arrows
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">
      Does not consume ammo
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The blaze bow is an upgrade to the vanilla bow that fires flaming arrows, and does not require ammunition! It burns out more quickly though.

## Redstone Crossbow

<table class='weapon-table'>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img alt="Redstone Crossbow" src="assets/img/posts/weapons/redstone_xbow.png" height="32" width="32" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <table>
  <tr><td>
      Uses:
    </td><td>
      384
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>
      Powerful shots
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">
      Consumes redstone
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">
      Fully automatic
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>



The redstone crossbow is a late game upgrade to the vanilla bow, and has several key differences. For a start, it consumes redstone instead of arrows. It also fires powerful flaming projectiles, and is fully automatic! (OK, so I may have gone a little overboard with the redstone crossbow, I'll admit it may be a little OP :P)
