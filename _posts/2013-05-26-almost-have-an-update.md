Happy Memorial Day weekend, for those of you in the US! Long weekends are great. I've actually managed to get some work done.

Turns out rebuilding my mod from scratch takes awhile (who'd have thought), so earlier today I took a break from "Xie's Mod 2.0" (gotta think of a better name for it) and hacked out a 1.5.x update for the old version. I've finished coding it, but it's buggy. No promises, but I hope to get it into releasable shape soon.

It's been so long, I just want to release SOMETHING. Then I can get back to working on the the new-and-improved version. I haven't fully updated some features, like armor, mountables, facing, glass, panes et al. I'm mainly concentrating on getting the default content working again, so that fruit trees, sammiches, salads, tacos, burritos, corn, cotton, and guacamole can be enjoyed again by all.
