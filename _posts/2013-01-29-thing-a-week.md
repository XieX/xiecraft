So I've been thinking I should start doing a Thing a Week (like Jonathan Coulton, but with modding, and much less awesome - Glee will never try to steal anything I create :3). Basically every weekend I'll try to release a new content pack, large or small, whatever I've managed to whip up during that week. It's a way to keep me making stuff, even when there's some hardcore debugging or refactoring that I should be doing instead.

Well it seems like a good idea, we'll have to see if it goes anywhere! XD
