I've been wanting to add some Nether crops to the game since Nether Wart was introduced, but never quite got around to beating out a decent design. So call this an experiment! This content pack adds three new plants - blaze trees, zombie pigmelons, and glowberry bushes. None of them spawn naturally, they must be crafted!

### Crimson Sickle

Firstly, you need to use the crimson sickle (crafted from blaze rods and nether brick) to harvest Nether Wart (with a RIGHT-CLICK, just like the foraging stick).

There's a small chance that in addition to dropping Nether Wart, the crop will also drop Ether Wart! Ether Wart can't be planted, but they can be used to splice seeds.

### Blaze Tree

![Blaze Tree Sapling](/assets/img/posts/nethercrops/craftblazesapling.jpg)

Blaze tree saplings are crafted from a sapling, ether wart and a blaze rod. They must be planted on soulsand, do not require light, can take a very long time to grow, and cannot be fertilized. Once grown, their trunks are made from blaze rods, and their leaves from flame! The leaves will hurt if you touch them, but won't actually set you on fire.

### Glowberry Bush

Glowberries are crafted from pumpkin seed and ether wart. When planted in soulsand, they grow into a glowberry bush, from which more glowberries can be harested (be careful not to accidentally destroy the bush when harvesting, though, just like tomato and cotton). Glowberry bushes require no light to grow, but even if they did it wouldn't matter because they shed light themselves anyway.

Glowberries cannot be eaten, but they can be smelted into glowstone dust!

### Zombie Pigmelon

Zombie pigmelon seeds are crafted from melon seeds and ether wart. When planted in soulsand, they grow zombie pigmelon vines (be patient, they do take some time to grow). Zombie pigmelons sprout from them, and I'll leave it to your imagination what zombie pigmelons can be crafted into!

## How to install

If you want this in your game you'll have to install my mod by unzipping it into ./mods/Xie, and then unzip this content pack into ./mods/Xie/content (or thereabouts).
