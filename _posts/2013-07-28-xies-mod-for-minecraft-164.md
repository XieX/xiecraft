## Known Bugs

Here is a list of ~~known bugs~~ the same old bugs that I never get around to fixing because I suck, if you find a bug that isn't on this list feel free to let me know.

* wheat override still suffers from infinite recursion
* metavariant plant spawning is still buggy (i.e. only shrubs and apple trees spawn naturally)
