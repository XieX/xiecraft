Quick update on the update to Minecraft 1.5! Things are going well, actually managed to clock some decent hours this weekend. I've finished rebuilding my mod's texture manager (well, mostly :P), but there's a bunch of refactoring I need to do to make the rest of the mod play nice with it.

While it is entirely possible that Minecraft 1.6 will be out before I finish updating to 1.5, I don't expect that update to be as involved as this one... it was mostly this texture stuff that messed me up. Totally my bad, I tend to get carried away with refactoring, and rip stuff out all over the place, then I walk away for a few days, come back and wonder what bugger has been messing with my code... you know how it is... :P

Anyway, still hope to have finished the update by the end of the month, so I'll be sure to provide some more excuses and another arbitrary deadline by then... ;)
