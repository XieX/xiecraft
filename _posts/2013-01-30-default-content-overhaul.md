Currently undergoing a major overhaul of the mod's default content, because it's been too long since I last did. A while back Cylan revised the default content, making it more modular for ease of enabling/disabling content, available for download as "Cylan's New Default Content". I liked what he did, so I'm working the two together (though taking care to maintain the identifiers so you won't have to edit your IDs). I'm taking the modularity a step further, and breaking things down as far as I can. For example, if you want to disable corn, now all you'll need to do is disable/delete "corn.xie" - one file, instead of editing 2 or 3 different files.

Cylan also introduced a few new items, most of which I'll be working into the revised default content. For example he added "Avocado Juice", which at first I found hilarious, but I googled it and turns out it's a real thing. Not only that, but it sounds BLOODY AMAZING! Might have to craft myself a pitcher of it for my next modding marathon...
