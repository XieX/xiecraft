<h2 id='xies_mod'>Xie&#8217;s Mod</h2>

<p>Xie&#8217;s Mod converts JSON content files into in-game content at runtime, allowing you to develop and deploy mod content without any coding or compiling. It comes packaged with the farming content I developed, but additional content packs are available, some authored by me, some authored by others. If you&#8217;re not shy about JSON syntax, or are willing to learn, feel free to give it a shot yourself. Start by taking a look at <a href='http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/923970-xies-mod-adding-your-own-content/'>this tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id='history_of_xies_mods'>History of Xie&#8217;s Mods</h2>

<p>Xie&#8217;s Hunger Mod was released on the 27th January 2011, and marked the beginning of a modding legacy that would span dozens of months&#8230; DOZENS! It was followed by a Food Stackability mod, a Farming mod and a Cooking mod.</p>

<p>Of course hunger and stackable food have long since been added to the base game, though at some stage I&#8217;d still like to revive my hunger mod since it also added thirst and fatigue mechanics. I&#8217;d also like to revive my cooking mod, which added a stove to the game letting you cook soups, stews, stir-fries and pancakes&#8230; One day.</p>

<p>The farming mod is the one that has survived to this day, having evolved from it&#8217;s original hard-coded form into a content pack for my runtime-content mod. Ironically I built said engine to make it easier and faster to create farming and food content, but these days I spend far more time expanding and maintaining the core mod.</p>
