This website is the home of Xie's mods for Minecraft, containing a development blog, download links, and more information about the mod. You are welcome to provide mod feedback via this website, via email, or on my [MinecraftForum.net thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/477267-v146-xies-mods/).

## Xie's Mod
Xie's Mod converts JSON content files into in-game content at runtime, allowing you to develop and deploy mod content without any coding or compiling. It comes packaged with the farming content I developed, but additional content packs are available, some authored by me, some authored by others. If you're not shy about JSON syntax, or are willing to learn, feel free to give it a shot yourself. Start by taking a look at [this tutorial](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/923970-xies-mod-adding-your-own-content/).

## History of Xie's Mods
Xie's Hunger Mod was released on the 27th January 2011, and marked the beginning of a modding legacy that would span dozens of months... DOZENS! It was followed by a Food Stackability mod, a Farming mod and a Cooking mod.

Of course hunger and stackable food have long since been added to the base game, though at some stage I'd still like to revive my hunger mod since it also added thirst and fatigue mechanics. I'd also like to revive my cooking mod, which added a stove to the game letting you cook soups, stews, stir-fries and pancakes... One day.

The farming mod is the one that has survived to this day, having evolved from it's original hard-coded form into a content pack for my runtime-content mod. Ironically I built said engine to make it easier and faster to create farming and food content, but these days I spend far more time expanding and maintaining the core mod.
