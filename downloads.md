On this page you can download the latest versions of Xie's mod. If you're looking for older versions, try looking in my [Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/xie-mc-mods/downloads/list").

## Xie's Mod for Minecraft 1.4.7
### ([Download Xie's Mod Feb13](http://xw-gs.com/mc/latest/Xie.zip))
Includes default farming content.

#### Installation Instructions

Assuming you have Minecraft Forge installed, download the zip file and copy it into the /mods directory inside your Minecraft home folder.

#### Modifying Block and Item IDs

Chances are you'll run into some block or item ID conflicts if you try to run my mod with any others. If this is the case, you can modify the block and item IDs for the default content by editing the ids.xid file in the default content directory. If you installed the mod as a zip file, you'll first need to extract it (remember to delete the zip file after you do).

## Extra Content
This section lists a number of additional content packs and content files. They require the core mod to be installed, and need to be placed into the directory ./mods/Xie (where "." is your Minecraft home).

### Default Farming Content 
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/FarmingContentApr16.zip)) (Contains textures by Thistle)
All of the classic farming content (fruit trees, tomatoes, cotton, corn, hybrid wheat etc) PLUS soy beans, tofu, tea, ketchup, cocoa trees, rose bushes, dandelion patches, carrots, onions, bottled milk, chocolate milk, and sweet tea, PLUS tacos, burritos etc. Added an override for vanilla wheat that drops hybrid wheat seeds 1% of the time. Rose and dandelion recipes have also been overridden, rose to rose seeds to red dye, and similarly for dandelions. Last updated April 16th 2012 - now includes tacos!

### Cylan's Default Farming Content 
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/newdefault.zip)) (Textures by Cylan)
This is the default farming content, reorginized and re-textured by Cylan. He split up the content into multiple directories and files to make it easier to find what you want to modify and/or disable (remember that adding an underscore to the start of a directory or file will cause it to be skipped over by the parsing engine).

### Classic Farming Content 
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/XieFarmingClassic_Apr2.zip))
If you don't want the updated content ("Default Farming Content" above) this download contains only the "classic" 2011 farming content - fruit trees, tomatos, cotton, corn, hybrid wheat, foraging stick, salt, salads, sammiches etc. Last updated April 2nd 2012.

### Xie's Weapons Mod
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/XieWeapons_Nov10.zip))
Adds three new swords and three new bows: Bone Sword, Glass Sword, Blaze Sword, Bone Bow, Blaze Bow, and a seriously OP fully automatic Redstone Crossbow! See the contained readme for more details and recipes. Last updated November 10th 2012.

### Cylan's Content
#### ([Link](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1406617-125-ct-boosters-for-xies-mod/)  [Wiki](http://ctboosters.wikia.com/wiki/CTBoosters_Wiki))
Cylan has added an enormous amount of new content (far more than comes in the default content pack), new trees, new crops, new ore (aluminium), new tools, new foods, herbs, ice fishing, bacon, ham, sausages... there's a lot of stuff, seriously XD

### Survival Tweaks
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/SurvivalTweaks.zip))
A collection of small mods to enhance early game survival. Includes Genshou's Survival Pickaxe, campfire, flint tools, clay furnace, smelt gravel to flint, sticks from saplings, and sticks from fences. Wood and stone tools are nerfed, making them less effective against stone, making mining impossible early-game. Cobblestone is not harvestable with wood or stone pickaxes, but stone tools are instead crafted from flint. The player must explore the world to find caves in which to find iron before they can build a mine.

### Better Logs (By Daniel_l94) 
#### ([Mediafire Download](http://www.mediafire.com/?xk7d827zew1rxav))
Adds a slight tint to log ends, depending on their type. Daniel also added wood stain which you can use to cycle through wood colors. See [Daniel's post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/477267-v125-xies-mods/page__view__findpost__p__14600263) for screenshots and more details!

### Pizzza's Pumpkins
#### ([Link](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1045361-pizzzas-pumpkins-mod-add-on-smp/))
Another contribution, Pizzza's content adds rockmelons, honeydew melons, butternut and Queensland Blue pumpkins! (And incidentally, Queensland is where I'm from )

### Apple Trees Only
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/appleTree_r1.zip))
Only want apple trees? This is the download for you.

### Colourful Stuff
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/colourfulstuff.zip)) (Lantern and glowstone textures by Thistle)
Adds coloured glowstone, lanterns, planks, fences, glass and windows. Only uses 2 extra block ids (for glowstone and lanterns, the rest just replace vanilla content). Note that fences aren't displayed correctly (just show as normal fences) unless you apply the RenderBlock patch, which is contained in zip file. Instructions in the readme.

### Currency
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/currencyR1.zip)) (Coin art by beyluna)
Adds iron nuggets, iron coins and gold coins. Coins are crafted from nuggets, and can be turned back into nuggets by smelting.

### Genshou's Survival Pickaxe
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/suvivalpickaxe.zip))
Overrides vanilla wood and stone pickaxes so they are less effective against stone, a simple nerf that is intended to enhance and extend the Minecraft early game, encouraging surface exploration and spelunking, until a source of iron is found. Credit goes to Genshou for the idea!

### Ultimate Fist Homage
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/ultimatefist.zip))
My homage to the classic mod by Iwannawin, the ultimate fist can punch through any block or (non-dragon) mob in one hit! Because sometimes you just need to run around punching your way through mountains and NPC villages...

### Sticks from Saplings
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/sticksFromSaplings.xie))
This is a tiny config file that makes it so you can craft saplings into sticks (by stripping the leaves off, I suppose). Works with or without fruit trees installed.

### Flint Tools
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/flintTools.zip))
Makes stone tools craftable from flint instead of cobblestone. Increases the lifetime of the early game by making stone tools a great deal more rare, plus adds a touch of realism. (If you want to keep the vanilla stone recipes all you need do is delete "cullStoneTools.xie").

### Coal Blocks Revised
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/CoalBlocksRevised.zip))
Expands on the coal blocks idea, adding charcoal blocks, hard coal, hard coal blocks, black diamonds, black diamond blocks and... fake diamonds! Only hard coal is a new source of fuel, the extra blocks nor black diamonds can be burned in the furnace, the latter is purely an intermediate ingredient for fabricating fake diamonds, which look like diamonds, but can only be used to make diamond tools, swords and armor. More details in the readme, but if my calculations are correct, you need 11.5 full stacks of coal, and just over 15 furnace-minutes to produce a single fake diamond! (NOTE: I have noticed a small bug that sometimes makes charcoal blocks smelt into 9 coal instead of just 1... not sure what's going on there, let me know if it happens to you too!) Cheers to Pyro1997 for the inspiration.

### Just Coal Blocks
#### ([Download](http://xie-mc-mods.googlecode.com/files/CoalBlock.zip))
Adds a coal block, crafted from 9 pieces of coal (not charcoal), and can be crafted back into 9 pieces of coal. It can also be burned in the furnace, providing 12 minutes of burn time (9 times as much as a piece of coal).
