On this page you can download the latest versions of Xie's mod. If you're looking for older versions, try looking in my [Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/xie-mc-mods/downloads/list").

## Xie's Mod for Minecraft 1.4.6 and 1.4.7
### ([Download](http://xw-gs.com/mc/Xie.zip))
Includes default farming content. Other content (ultimate fist, weapons and survival tweaks) are included but disabled, but you can unzip and remove the underscores from the start of the folder names in the content directory to enable them. Requires Minecraft Forge.

#### Installation Instructions

Assuming you have Minecraft Forge installed, download the zip file and copy it into the /mods directory inside your Minecraft home folder.

## Extra Content
This section lists a number of additional content packs and content files. They require the core mod to be installed, and need to be placed into the directory ./mods/Xie (where "." is your Minecraft home).
